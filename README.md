This project is a static HTML-based landing page for PaperGrid Notebooks, a fictional stationery brand. The design features a clean and intuitive layout with essential sections including product thumbnails, company information, contact details, and navigation options. It serves as a simple, responsive front-end prototype suitable for showcasing branded products and business details.
